## Welcome to Radish Lab's mini guide to NationBuilder!

This site is a general introduction to the NationBuilder platform chock full of useful tips and tricks to get you started. It's geared towards developers (but, helpful for anyone with a bit of coding knowledge) looking to learn must-know concepts, strategies and approaches to the platform.

We won't cover every topic with detail and depth, but we will provide some high-level context and guidance, plus we’ll throw in a few quick and dirty code snippets!. This manual’s purpose is to fill in gaps we see that exist in current NationBuilder resources. It was created by Radish Lab as an internal resource, but with the support of the NationBuilder team, we want to make it available to all.

## What is NationBuilder

Nation Builder is an online content management system featuring a robust donation platform and volunteer admin system along with some nice calendar and event ticketing integration among other features and all with some powerful sharing tools. Basically, it's a powerful tool for organizing people online. But just what does that mean?

Well you can think of it as a platform for making websites that also provides a host of integrated tools to help coordinate communities around a common goal, with the website as one part of a multifaceted approach. So in that way, NationBuilder is conceptually different from other platforms on the web and quite a bit more ambitious. It connects your site to a ready-made framework for organizing, coordinating, and communicating with users. It also includes powerful financial tools necessary for many initiatives, and provides optimal control over how it all goes together. NationBuilder serves up an impressive breadth and depth of functionality while still being incredibly customizable, scalable, and flexible.

And that is no easy feat.

For a product like this to be universally adaptable, it has to make trade-offs, which can be limiting. So you need to be aware of its restrictions as well as its functional attributes. NationBuilder is a complex piece of software, but the more you work with it, the more you see the thought that went into making every piece connect as seamlessly as possible.

Radish Lab is now a certified NationBuilder architect so yes, I am biased. We don’t recommend NationBuilder for every project, but it can be a great option for certain types of clients, including nonprofits, educational institutions, advocacy groups, and political organizations; anyone who wants to raise funds, hold an event, boost awareness, spark action, or create a movement.
